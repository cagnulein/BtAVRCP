# BtAVRCP
Simple PyBluez project for Bluetooth AVRCP 

A simple example of a Bluetooth AVRCP session.

Implemented in Python3 with PyBluez

You will need to change the "addr" settings in code to point to a your own device. 

If the service search does not immediately find your device, check that your device is on and not already connected to another hos, and that the host machine's bluetooth adapter is actually on.

Sometimes it takes a few attempt to connect.
